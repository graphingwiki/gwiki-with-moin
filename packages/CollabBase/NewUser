#!wiki tip

If you are an existing user you can use the <<Action(Invite, invite action)>> to invite someone else to collaborate. An invitation email ([[InviteNewTemplate | template for new users]] or [[InviteOldTemplate | template for old users]]) will be sent and the account and password created automagically if needed. Inviting from AccessGroup page will authorize the invited user to access this collab.

Alternatively you can create the user with the <<Action(newaccount, new account action)>>. This allows you to choose the password. Please always supply a valid email address!
