''The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created in order to encourage
greater sharing of information. In order to encourage the sharing of
sensitive information, however, the originator needs to signal how
widely they want their information to be circulated beyond the
immediate recipient, if at all.

The TLP provides a simple method to achieve this. It is designed to
improve the flow of information between individuals, organisations or
communities in a controlled and trusted way. It is important that
everyone understands and obeys the rules of the protocol. Only then
can trust be established and the benefits of information sharing
realised. The TLP is based on the concept of the originator labeling
information with one of four colours to indicate what further
dissemination, if any, can be undertaken by the recipient. The
recipient must consult the originator if wider dissemination is
required.'' -- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol | From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]]
